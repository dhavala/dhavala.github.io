     	<br><br> The most enjoyable part of being an Applied Statistician is the opportunity to work on many different problems. They could range from Educational psychology 	to Construction management to Biolology to Horticulture. Being present in a large university such as TAMU provides those opportunties time and again. I worked with many students on their problems whenever they are in need of a statistician. The association, most of the time, is at personal level, rather than a professional colloboration. I consider this as an opportunity to spread awareness about statisitcs and its role in discoveing the truth and I never expected anything in return. Below, you will find selected topics that I worked over past few years.  
	<ul>
	<li> Item response theory (educational psychology: modeling latent traits in subjects)
	<li> Regression (construction management: relationships between cost, type project etc..)
	<li> Clustering and trend analysis ( in Wild life and Fisheries)
	<li> Sequentia Bayesian analysis ( in electrical engineering: circuit breaker failure analysis)
	<li> Contigency tables ( in construction science: site accidents in the hispanic community )
	<li> Bayesian GLMs ( in Civil engineering: modeling traffic accidents)
	<li> Binary Classification ( in Biology: classification of samples given a covariate)
	</ul>
	<p>In general, I do not say NO to anyone. If I do not know the solution immediately, I will research about the problem. I learnt quite a few things, like Item response theory for eg., due to this policy  </p>
