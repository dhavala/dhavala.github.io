	I was born in <a href="vzm.html">Vizianagaram</a>, a historical town in the north coastal region of <a class="ext"href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> in India. However, I grew up in a small village called <a href="dvp.html">Devupalli</a>, that is about 20kms north-west of Vizianagaram, as both my parents were working in the local governament high school. I studied in the same school till my 10th grade (<a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education">high school</a>) in <a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language">Telugu</a> medium. I am a strong supporter of the idea that one should be taught in his/her mother tongue.</p>  

<p>I consider the general atmosphere in the school and the village to be very peaceful and relaxed, at least in those times. I particularly enjoyed the tutoring sessions with Raju Meshaaru&dagger, Kurminayudu meshaaru (our headmaster at that time), Ratnakar mesharu. I always liked the easthetic part of mathematics, in particular, algebra.   Raju Meshaaru  had a unique style: his lectures are like stories/tales. You listen to him once and you will never forget. Thank you Sir!

My father was a social sciences teacher. But he was known for his social activities in the village than for his acadamic duties. We had a social club in the school that my father started. It was the place for us to dicuss politics, conduct mock parliaments and quizzes on general knowledge, report news every morning during the shcool assembly. We used to oragnize fund-raising events to help the victims of natural disasters. We used to tour neighbouring villages to promote education-for-adults (not to mistaken for adult education). Every evening, we used to play <a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_badminton">ball-badmiton</a> in the open fields. I think all these activities had a tremendous impact on me in some form or the other.

<p> I was put in a residential college for my secondary high school education (or +2 or intermediate) in Vijayawada. However, I did not the like the way they were teaching. You have to practice everything that you were taught. You are seen like a memory machine more or less. I could not enjoy my stay there anymore and returned to Vizianagaram for completing the senior year. I studied on my own ( I rarely attended college). As you can expect my percentage dropped down tremendously. But I learnt the art of self-learning & independent thinking. I can see traces of this thought even in my grad school, putting the grades at risk, often times :)

My mother is an excellent artisit, singer and writer. She can sit for hours on a particular painting. As a kid, I could not understand how she can focus on a particular thing for so long. and used to pester for her attention. Now, I know what it means. She started playing <a class-"ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veena">veena</a>, when I was 12. Now she holds a diplamo in Veena theory. In the middle of their careers, both my father and mother pursued M.A in Philosophy. I passively partcicipated in their discussion. It is this spirit, If I can say, that was behind my decision to quit job and apply for grad school, however unconventional it was then.

<p>I got married to Deepika on July 1st 2007. Dont you think it is time for the story to begin on a new page!</p>
