	<p>  All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages. <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp -William Shakespeare. </p>

<p> That stage comes to life,  if the space between the entrance and the exit is filled with some entertainment, excitement and drama. That life will serve a purpose, if one is enlightened in that process.</p>

I acted in several plays. Some of them are here: 
<ul>	
<li> as a henpecked husband in <a   class="pop", href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znffc1ZzOkk"  target ="_blank"> When X > Y </a>  <br>a drama exploring the world in which the role played by the gender is reversed  ( I enter @ 4.00 mins) <br><br>
</li>

<li> as a narrator in <a   class="pop", href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1717408738854059373"  target ="_blank"> Design for Secureing Sita </a> <br> a short fantacy skit exploring contemporary Ramayana <br><br>
</li>

<li> as a dancer in <a   class="pop", href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIyi-8Loo_Y"  target ="_blank"> How not to Dance </a> <br> a fusion of Bharat Natyam and some popular Bollywood steps. I always wanted to perform classical dance on stage but I never learnt classical dance. I fulfilled my wish this way. I learnt how difficult it is to master these art forms <br><br>
</li>

</ul>

But all of them were cast in an informal set-up. You act with your instincts and by impersonating the characters's closest match in real-world. But what is acting? Is there a scientific approach to acting. I got a chance to learn about acting in a professional set-up when Prof. Micheal Greenwald of the Dept. of Performance Studies at TAMU was screening  Indian actors for his adaptation of Susan Townsend <i>The Great Celestial cow</i>

<ul>	
	<p>  I played as a cameraman as well as a young groom and these characters' histrionics were to bring a comic relief to an otherwise series play. To my surprise, Prof. Greenwald did not <i>direct</i> us per say but instead he <i>corrected</i> and suggested <i>adjustments</i>  to our acting, which helped all of us (the ametuer lot) to be at ease and present our best.  Just to satify my curiosity, I borrowed videos on method acting introduced by Stanislavski from the library and to some extent benifited from this experience.This is what the local newspapers have to say about our play:

<ul><a   class="pop", href="http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2006/03/02/Aggielife/Holy-Cow-1650434.shtml"  target ="_blank"> Holy Cow </a> (The Battalion) </li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul><a   class="pop", href="http://209.189.226.235/stories/022306/entertainment_20060223059.php"  target ="_blank"> Indian actors lend authenticity to play </a> (The Eagle) </li>
</ul><br>
For the first time in my life, I gave my autograph to a fellow Aggie. That was an incredible feeling.
</p>
</ul>

<p>  A keen sense of observation, and the observation of the self and the surroundings, play greater role in bridging the gap between "acting" and "living". After all, world is a stage and we are mere players.
