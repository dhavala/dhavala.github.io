	<p>  Of all the departments in video making, I consider <i>editing</i> as the most toughest part and the time consuming one. You can completely tell a different story based on the same raw footage. It is the place where you can correct the mistakes or you can make new ones. Essentially, an editor can make or break a story. </p>

<ul>	
	<p>  Shown below is a promotional video we made for the Texas A &M Chapter of <i>Child Rights and You </i>. Video footage is taken from "Baraka". It is a mind-boggling video/documentary highlighting the contrasts that exist in the world along the cultural, economical, and social lines. I took some pieces from this extraordinary video, edited it to make a point: that is to invite students and other community members to attend a fund-rasing dance party that the CRY chapter is organizing. The sound track is taken from <i>Blood Diamond</i>. Ever since I heard the track the first time, I became a great fan of JamesNewton Howard, its music composer.

</p>

</ul>

Choosing right music is also important. The combined effect/impact of audio and video is much greater then the individual effects combined. Unless you have a complete sound track available or you have access to a musician who can compose the background score, it may be necessary to edit the audio as well. Audio editing, sound engineering can be viewed as digital signal processing.  This is what I did in Jana Gana Remix
	

<ul>	
	<p>  Jana Gana Mana is the Indian National Anthem, written by nobel laureate Rabindra Nath Tagore. A. R Rehman who won two oscars for his musical talents in Slumdog Millionaire (2009), composed the music. There are many versions: vocal, instrumental (individual and combined). I chose sections of the orginal compositions and stitched them together. The video for this composition was again taken Vande Mataram and several other sources avaiable from the internet.

</ul>


<p>  One can easily learn various editing techniques, but using the right tools at the right time is much of an art than of science.
